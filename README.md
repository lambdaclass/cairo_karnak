# Karnak - Cairo Ahead-of-Time compiler

The idea of this project is to implement an optimistic Cairo language compiler
to run Cairo programs as fast as possible, while ignoring the checks that are
present in a full-blown VM.

The first version won't be designed to generate executables.

## Roadmap

**First version**

The initial version is just a simple VM with the required functionality, just to
prove the concept.

It will load the JSON generated by StarkWare's `cairo-compile`, run those
instructions without any checks. It should be small. 

**Second version: Rust backend**

The next iteration should add a Rust backend. That is, a backend that generates
Rust code, compiles it, and finally executes it.

This version will still use the same JSON as the program input. This version may
link to a runtime library for portions of code that doesn't make sense to
codegen when outputting Rust code, such as BigInt operations and hint execution.

**Third version: C or LLVM IR backend**

After Rust, the next iteration should add either a C or an LLVM IR backend. It
should speed up the compilation of the generated code into machine code, as well
as its execution.

**Full compiler**

The final iteration will replace the JSON used until now with a cairo source
code lexer and parser, therefore eliminating the need for `cairo-compile` entirely.
